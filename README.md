# Hello!

This website is a recreation of one I have made previously to help me practice React.
The original was a joke site in reference of Jett one-tricks, players of the videogame Valorant who used the aformentioned character whenever possible.

The app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[React Router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router) was used to have multiple pages.
